####Input 
Program expects an upper bound for finding primes. Program can be called like ```./prime-generator 1000```

####Testing Different Configurations
In order to output different results with respect to different parameters, you can execute the ```run.sh``` file. It
will give a output in the form of ```csv``` file. Bash script expects an executable. You can call the script in the form of
```./run.sh prime-generator``` after successful compilation of program. If you want to change the openmp parameters,
you can easily change them in the script.
